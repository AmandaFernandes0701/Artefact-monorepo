## Introduction

The Artefact project is a task management application designed to streamline personal productivity. This repository houses the backend component, a robust and efficient API built with tRPC, serving as the central data management hub for the application.

This project was conceived as a practical exercise, focusing on building a Next.js (v15) application with a task management system at its core. The backend, leveraging tRPC, maintains the task list in memory (for simplicity, without database persistence) and exposes endpoints for the frontend to consume.

**Key Features:**

*   **Task Creation:** Users can add new tasks with a title (required), description (optional), and creation timestamp.
*   **Task Listing:** Retrieves a comprehensive list of all existing tasks.
*   **Task Updates:** Enables modification of existing task details.
*   **Task Deletion:** Allows removal of tasks from the list.

**Project Goals:**

*   Develop a well-structured and maintainable backend API.
*   Implement robust validation and error handling.
*   Provide a seamless integration experience for the frontend.
*   Showcase best practices in software architecture and development.

## Software Architecture

The backend architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability. It follows a layered approach, separating concerns into distinct modules:

*   **Controllers:** Handle incoming requests, orchestrate business logic execution, and return responses.
*   **Services:** Encapsulate core business logic, ensuring code reusability and testability.
*   **Data Models:** Define the structure of data entities (tasks), promoting consistency and type safety.
*   **Repositories (Optional):** Abstract data access logic, enabling easy switching of data storage mechanisms.
*   **Utilities:** House helper functions and common logic used across the application.

This architecture promotes:

*   **Loose Coupling:** Changes in one module have minimal impact on others.
*   **High Cohesion:** Each module has a specific responsibility.
*   **Testability:** Individual modules can be easily unit tested.

## Backend (tRPC)

### Data Modeling

Tasks are modeled with the following attributes:

*   `id`: A unique identifier (UUID) for each task.
*   `title`: The task's title (required, string).
*   `description`: Additional details about the task (optional, string).
*   `createdAt`: Timestamp of task creation.

### API Endpoints & Business Logic

The tRPC API provides the following endpoints:

*   `createTask`: Creates a new task, validating input and returning the created task.
*   `listTasks`: Retrieves all tasks, potentially with pagination or filtering in the future.
*   `updateTask`: Updates an existing task, ensuring the task exists and input is valid.
*   `deleteTask`: Deletes a task, verifying its existence before removal.

Business logic is implemented within services, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

### Validation and Error Handling

*   **Input Validation:** Zod is used to validate all incoming data, ensuring type safety and preventing invalid data from entering the system.
*   **Error Handling:** Custom error classes are used to represent specific error scenarios, providing informative messages to the frontend.
*   **Centralized Error Handling:** Middleware captures errors and transforms them into user-friendly responses.

---

## Technology Stack

*   **Node.js (v18+):** The runtime environment for the backend.
*   **Express.js (v4+):** A web framework for building the API.
*   **tRPC (v10+):** A library for creating type-safe APIs.
*   **Zod (v3+):** A schema validation library.
*   **TypeScript (v5+):** A typed superset of JavaScript.
*   **Jest (v29+):** A testing framework for unit and integration tests.

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/artefact-backend.git](https://github.com/your-username/artefact-backend.git)
    cd artefact-backend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Testing with Postman

1.  Import the Postman collection (provided separately).
2.  Configure environment variables in Postman.
3.  Send requests to the API endpoints.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Database Integration:** Persist tasks in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
*   **Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization.
*   **Advanced Features:** Add features like task prioritization, due dates, and collaboration.
*   **Improved Testing:** Expand test coverage to include integration tests and end-to-end tests.

## Conclusion

The Artefact backend provides a solid foundation for a feature-rich task management application. Its modular architecture, robust validation, and use of modern technologies ensure scalability and maintainability. The project demonstrates best practices in software development and provides a valuable learning experience.
