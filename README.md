## Backend

### Software Architecture <a name="backend-architecture"></a>

The backend is architected with a strong emphasis on modularity, separation of concerns, and adherence to Clean Architecture principles. The design ensures that each layer can evolve independently while maintaining a consistent contract across the application. Key architectural patterns include:

- **Layered Approach:**
    - **Application (Use Cases):** Implements specific business logic (e.g., `TarefaUseCases.ts`) following SOLID principles and ensuring that business rules remain isolated from infrastructural concerns.
    - **Domain (Entities):** Defines core entities (such as `Tarefa.ts`) encapsulating business rules and invariants. This layer is agnostic of external dependencies.
    - **Infrastructure:** Although not fully utilized in the current scope, this layer is designed to manage external integrations like databases, external APIs, or messaging systems, making future enhancements seamless.
    - **Presentation (Routers):** Exposes HTTP endpoints using Express.js and tRPC, translating user requests into application commands.
    - **Utilities:** Contains shared logic (e.g., custom error classes, logging, helper functions) that promotes DRY principles across the application.

This architectural strategy not only increases code maintainability and testability but also aligns with industry-standard practices for enterprise-grade applications.

### Data Modeling <a name="backend-data-modeling"></a>

Tasks are modeled as domain entities with a focus on immutability and consistency. The data structure includes:

- **id:** A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) that ensures each task is uniquely identifiable.
- **title:** A required string representing the task's title.
- **description:** An optional string providing further details about the task.
- **createdAt:** A timestamp marking the creation time of the task, useful for auditing and chronological sorting.

This model is designed to be easily extensible; future iterations could incorporate additional attributes such as task status, priority levels, due dates, and relational mappings for collaborative environments.

### API Endpoints & Business Logic <a name="backend-api-endpoints"></a>

The backend API, built on tRPC, provides a type-safe and efficient interface for client-server communication. The main endpoints include:

- **`createTask`:**
    - **Function:** Creates a new task.
    - **Validation:** Ensures the input meets stringent criteria using Zod schemas.
    - **Business Logic:** Applies domain rules before persisting the new task.
- **`listTasks`:**
    - **Function:** Retrieves all tasks.
    - **Optimization:** Can be extended to support pagination, filtering, and sorting for enhanced performance.
- **`updateTask`:**
    - **Function:** Modifies an existing task.
    - **Validation:** Checks for the existence of the task and validates input changes.
- **`deleteTask`:**
    - **Function:** Deletes a specified task.
    - **Verification:** Confirms the task exists and that the deletion meets business criteria.

Centralizing the business logic within use cases decouples application rules from transport mechanisms, ensuring consistency and facilitating unit testing.

### Validation and Error Handling <a name="backend-validation"></a>

Robust validation and error handling mechanisms are critical for maintaining application integrity:

- **Input Validation:**
    - Utilizes Zod to enforce runtime type-checking and data integrity. This ensures that only valid data is processed by the business logic.
- **Custom Error Classes:**
    - Implements specific error types to clearly differentiate between client-side and server-side issues, aiding in debugging and user feedback.
- **Middleware for Centralized Error Handling:**
    - A dedicated error-handling middleware intercepts exceptions, logs them appropriately, and returns standardized error responses. This mechanism is extensible and can integrate with external monitoring tools.

### Technology Stack <a name="backend-technology"></a>

- **Node.js (v18+):** Provides a robust runtime environment with support for modern JavaScript features.
- **Express.js (v4+):** A lightweight framework that simplifies routing and middleware integration.
- **tRPC (v10+):** Ensures end-to-end type safety between the client and server, reducing runtime errors.
- **Zod (v3+):** Facilitates schema-based validation with a focus on developer productivity and code clarity.
- **TypeScript (v5+):** Enhances code reliability and maintainability through static type checking.

These technologies were chosen for their proven track records in building scalable and maintainable applications, enabling rapid development without compromising on quality.

### Folder Structure & Workflow <a name="backend-folder-structure"></a>

The backend repository is organized to reflect its layered architecture:
```
ðŸ“¦ backend  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ dist                       # Arquivos JavaScript compilados (output do TypeScript)
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ src                      # CÃ³digo compilado do backend
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ src                        # CÃ³digo-fonte do backend
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ application              # Casos de uso (ex.: TarefaUseCases.ts)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ config                   # ConfiguraÃ§Ãµes e variÃ¡veis de ambiente
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ domain                   # Modelos de domÃ­nio e entidades de negÃ³cio (ex.: Tarefa.ts) 
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ infrastructure           # IntegraÃ§Ãµes futuras (banco de dados, APIs externas)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ presentation             # Rotas e controladores da API (ex.: TarefaRouter.ts)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ utils                    # FunÃ§Ãµes utilitÃ¡rias e tratamento de erros 
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ server.ts                # Ponto de entrada; configura servidor e middlewares
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ errorMessages.ts         # Mensagens de erro centralizadas para consistÃªncia
```

**Workflow Overview:**

1. **Request Handling:**  
   - Incoming HTTP requests are first processed by the **presentation** layer.
2. **Business Logic Execution:**  
   - Routers delegate operations to **use cases** in the **application** layer.
3. **Domain Processing:**  
   - Use cases interact with **domain** entities, ensuring business rules are enforced.
4. **Response Formation:**  
   - Processed results are formatted and returned to the client via the routers.
5. **Error Management:**  
   - Any exceptions trigger centralized error handling, ensuring consistent client feedback.

This structure promotes clarity, ease of navigation, and scalability, allowing for smooth incorporation of new features and modules.
